Support Options
===============

If you have questions, comments, or need help with the plugins, there are
several options to consider.

You can get self-service help via `Percona's forums<http://forum.percona.com>`_,
or the `Percona mailing
list<https://groups.google.com/group/percona-discussion/>`_.

You can report bugs and submit patches to the `Launchpad
project<https://launchpad.net/percona-monitoring-plugins>`_.

If you need help with installation, troubleshooting, configuration, selecting
services to monitor, deciding on appropriate thresholds, writing more plugins,
extending or modifying existing plugins, or fixing bugs in plugins, you may wish
to consider a `MySQL Support Contract<http://www.percona.com/mysql-support/>`_
from Percona.  These monitoring plugins are fully supported under all Percona
contracts.
